/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access and modify data that belongs to them.
 * Data Structure: All user-specific data is nested under the `/users/{userId}` path, with further subcollections for clients, purchases, and payments. Top-level `/products` collection is intended for public reads, with restricted writes.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *   - Users can only list documents within their own user subcollections. Listing other user's data is denied.
 *   - Data consistency between the path and document fields (userId, clientId) is strictly enforced.
 *   - Public read access is granted to the `/products` collection, but writes are only allowed if an 'ownerId' field is added to the entity and the user matches the owner.
