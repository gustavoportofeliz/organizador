/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for client data,
 *              while allowing public read access to product information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client data, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase history for a specific client, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment information for a specific client, owned by the user.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores publicly readable product information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data and client-related data (clients, purchases, payments) are strictly
 *   accessible only by the authenticated user who owns the data.
 * - Products are publicly readable but only writable with appropriate access control (TODO).
 * - Listing of client collections and their subcollections is allowed only for the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The data structure inherently denormalizes the user ID by nesting client data
 *   under the /users/{userId} path. This avoids the need for `get()` calls to
 *   verify ownership.  The client documents themselves contain a `userId` field,
 *   which is validated upon creation and made immutable thereafter to prevent
 *   data leakage or unauthorized access.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Publicly readable product information is stored in a separate top-level
 *   collection (/products) to avoid mixing public and private data. This improves
 *   security and performance for list operations.
