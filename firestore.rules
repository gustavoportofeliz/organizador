/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data except product.
 * All user-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the userId matching the Firebase auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client information for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase history for each client.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment information for each client.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information that is publicly readable, but writeable only with proper authentication using `ownerId`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to protect user privacy.
 * - All data is nested under the user's ID to simplify authorization logic and prevent cross-user data access.
 * - Product data is readable by all, but only those with proper access can create, update, or delete it.
