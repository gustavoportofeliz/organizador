/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where users can only access data under their own user ID.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring data isolation and simplifying security rules.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage data within their own /users/{userId} path.
 * - Listing of the top-level /users collection is disallowed.
 * - Authorization relies solely on the authenticated user's ID and the hierarchical data structure.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client information for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase history for a specific client.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment information for a specific client.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information (publicly readable, owner-writeable).
