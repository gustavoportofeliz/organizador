/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for data access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client data, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase data, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment data, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product data, publicly readable, with owner-only writes (requires 'ownerId' or 'authorId' field in the product document).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is isolated using subcollections under /users/{userId}.
 * - Only the authenticated user can read or write their own user and client data.
 * - Products are publicly readable but require authentication and ownership to create, update, or delete.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The userId is implicitly available from the path, avoiding the need for get() calls to verify ownership.
