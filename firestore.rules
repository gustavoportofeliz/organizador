     * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access and modify data associated with their own user ID.
     * @dataStructure Data is organized hierarchically, with user data nested under /users/{userId}, client data under /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}, and further nested purchase and payment data.
     * @keySecurityDecisions User listing is disallowed.  All write operations require the user to be the owner of the data. Public read access is granted to the /products collection, but write access is restricted.
     * @denormalization Denormalization is implicitly achieved by the hierarchical data structure. The user ID is embedded in the path, making it directly accessible for authorization checks without requiring additional reads.
     * @structuralSegregation User-specific private data (clients, purchases, payments) is stored under the /users/{userId} path, while public product data resides in the top-level /products collection.
