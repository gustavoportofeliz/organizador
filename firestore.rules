/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data,
 * ensuring users can only access their own data. It also allows public read access to Products,
 * while restricting modifications to authenticated users who own the respective product.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client information for a specific user. Only the user can read/write their own clients.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase history for a specific client of a specific user. Only the user can read/write purchases.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment information for a specific client of a specific user. Only the user can read/write payments.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information.  Public read access, owner-only writes.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - All write operations are explicitly authorized; there are no `allow write: if true;` rules.
 * - Ownership is validated on both create and update operations to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
