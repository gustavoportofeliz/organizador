/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data,
 * ensuring users can only access their own data. The /products collection
 * allows public read access but restricts writes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client data owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase history for a client.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment information for a client.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information (publicly readable).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) require a valid authentication.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields to enable rapid prototyping.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /products collection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The data structure itself enforces ownership.  The userId is encoded in the path for
 *    user-specific collections.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Public /products are separated from private user data.
