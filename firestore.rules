/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 *
 * @Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data stored under the `/users/{userId}` path. Each user has exclusive access to their own data, including clients, purchases, and payments. The top-level `/products` collection is publicly readable but only writable by an owner (TODO: currently missing).
 * @Data Structure:
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 *   - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client information for a specific user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/purchases/{purchaseId}: Stores purchase history for a specific client of a specific user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payment information for a specific client of a specific user.
 *   - /products/{productId}: Stores product information.
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 *   - User data is isolated: Users can only access data under their own `/users/{userId}` path.
 *   - Strong Ownership: All write operations (create, update, delete) require the user to be the owner of the data.
 *   - Public Read for Products: The `/products` collection is publicly readable, allowing all users to view product information.  Write permissions are restricted (TODO: currently missing owner field).
 *   - No User Listing: Listing users is not permitted.
 * @Denormalization for Authorization: The data structure is designed to avoid `get()` calls. All authorization context is available within the document path.
 * @Structural Segregation: Private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, while public product data is stored in a top-level collection `/products`.
